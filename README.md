# Redux-Thunk Exercise

* In this project, I have used **Redux-Thunk**. I had used **React-Redux** in some of my previous projects and also Redux-Thunk, but wanted to make a separate exercise for it.
* I used [rest countries api v2](https://restcountries.com/) as a source of api.
* I ignored the style, just basic redux-thunk exercise with an api.
